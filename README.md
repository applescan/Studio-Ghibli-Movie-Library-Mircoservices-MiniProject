# Studio Ghibli Movie MiniProject


The third mini-project is designed to cover material learned in modules 5,  8 and 9 around using express and databases. 

The goal is to create a real-time database after fetching data externally via an API. The project should follow the MVC model, and ideally include a start-up routine that initially fetches the data and populates the database. 

All CRUD operations should be included, and demonstrated via Postman or Swagger (a front-end is not required). The database structure should reflect the structure of the data returned from the external API.
